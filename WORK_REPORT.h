/*
    Features:
        -Note Implemented:

        -Implemented: create,select with multiple and single conditions, drop and delete

        -Partly implemented:


    Bugs     : The one bug inside of this code that is known is one dealing with my vector 
    as i did not have enough time to properaly implement it there will be data leaks due 
    to it not having a destructor

    Reflections:
    overall I thought this assignment was interesting as its the first time I have ever gone back
    and relied on code I had previous written. Another thing this puts into perspective is the
    fact that It shows just how little I document my code. This was discovered when I would need 
    to go back and relearn my previous code that needed some adjustments for this class.
